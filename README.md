### **How to Install**



To install a custom or unofficial Chrome extension (one not from the Web Store), you must use Developer Mode. This process is often called "loading an unpacked extension". 



#### 1\. Prepare Your Extension Files

&nbsp;	Download or Create: Ensure you have the extension’s folder. If it is a .zip file, you must unzip/extract it first.

&nbsp;	Verify Contents: The folder must contain a file named manifest.json. This is the core file Chrome uses to recognize the extension.

&nbsp;	Permanent Location: Move the folder to a permanent location (like a "Documents" subfolder). If you delete or move the folder later, the extension will stop working. 



#### 2\. Enable Developer Mode 

&nbsp;	Open Google Chrome.

&nbsp;	In the address bar, type chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.

&nbsp;	In the top-right corner, find the Developer mode toggle and switch it On. 



#### 3\. Load the Extension

&nbsp;	Click the Load unpacked button that appears in the top-left.

&nbsp;	Navigate to and select the folder containing your extension files (the one with manifest.json).

&nbsp;	Click Select Folder (Windows) or Open (Mac).

&nbsp;	The extension will now appear in your list and is ready to use. 



#### 4\. Manage and Troubleshoot

&nbsp;	Pin for Access: Click the Extensions (puzzle piece) icon next to your profile picture and click the Pin icon to keep the custom extension visible.

&nbsp;	Errors: If the extension doesn't load, check for an "Errors" button on the extension's card in the manager. This usually indicates a syntax error in the manifest.json file.

&nbsp;	Updates: If you change the code in your custom extension folder, you must click the Reload (circular arrow) icon on the extension's card to apply the changes.
